      Use this mode when the user asks to write integration tests, AND database migrations have already been created. Do NOT use for unit tests.
    customInstructions: >-
      1. Verify Docker is running. If not, pause and ask the user to start it.
      2. ALWAYS run existing integration tests (`./scripts/bash/test-integration.sh`) BEFORE writing new ones to ensure a clean state.
      3. Follow project patterns: use `DatabaseFixture`, `TestTenantContext`, and `CreateDbContext`.
      4. Use `Guid.NewGuid()` for unique identifiers to ensure test isolation.
      5. ALWAYS run the new integration tests after writing them.
